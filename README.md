# Iris-Flower-prediction

Agenda
A (VERY) basic introduction to the Linear Regression Model.
A basic introduction to the Iris Data.
Codes for predictions using a Linear Regression Model.

What is a Linear Regression Model?
Linear Regression is a type of Regression Model and a Supervised Learning Algorithm in Machine Learning. It is one of the basic Machine Learning Model every Machine Learning enthusiast should know. Linear Regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (y — dependent variables) and one or more explanatory variables (X — independent variables).

I will be exemplifying the use of Linear Regression to predict the sepal length (cm) of a genus of flower called Iris.
